title: Tiny ML Projects
---

Do you have a list of ideas you would like to work on “someday” but never get around to actually do it? I am like that. 

I have a lot of ideas I’d like to execute. However, I get distracted by the next shiny project and never get to finish the ones I am working on.

I’ve started this website to build & share simple yet meaningful ML projects.

The projects I share should demonstrate standard ML pipelines.

They should be tiny enough to be finished over a weekend.

There must be a demo. [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) is a nice tool for demos. The best part is that they could be hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
